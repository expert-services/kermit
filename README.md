# Kermit

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that helps facilitate the delegated bypass request process

## Requirements
1. A GitHub App must be installed on the Organization that you wish to enable Issues-based collaboration for delegated bypass requests on
     - The **GitHub App name** must be supplied with a name (e.g., my-org-kermit)
     - The **Homepage URL** must be provided (e.g., https://github.com/expert-services/kermit )
     - The initial **Webhook URL** must be a temporary one (e.g., https://example.com)
     - A **Webhook secret** must be generated and used
     - It must have
       - **Read-and-Write** to **Issues** as a Repository permission
       - **Read-only** to **Secret scanning alerts** as a Repository permission
       - **Read-only** to **Custom organization roles** as an Organization permission
       - **Read-only** to **Members** as an Organization permission
     - It must be subscribed to the **Exemption request secret scanning** event
     - It should be installed **Only on this account** (i.e., not on Any account)

> [!NOTE]  
> Organization permissions need to be approved by an Organization Owner

2. Generate a **Private key** for the GitHub App and Base64 encode the associated `.pem` file

    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ base64 -i oodles-noodles-kermit.YYYY-MM-DD.private-key.pem
    LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQpNSUlFb3dJQkFBS0NBUUVBa2xwaVlUdEZQbG5kdWdySDNOcGlvaGNZN1ZwNTlYMkhGTjJXM
    jZKdHkzYkRJWTJCClpJc20rRGN5dEZNb0kxbUg3UGUvUk1CN0xuOXZLS2N5Sk1kNVRuakxwUTBZWGdCOFRlQzdTa2tHNFB3alZKWlEKK1RlN3hiQU
    ...
    ...

    foo@bar:~$
    ```
3. Install the GitHub App on all the repositories in the Organization
4. Create a repository to store needed configuration items and deploy required infrastructure
5. Create values the following as **Repository secrets** in the repository created in Step 4
     - **CLIENT_ID**: The client ID of the Azure App Registration used to deploy infrastructure
     - **TENANT_ID**: The tenant ID of the Azure App Registration used to deploy infrastructure
     - **SUBSCRIPTION_ID**: The subscription ID of the Azure subscription that infrastructure is to be deployed to
     - **APP_ID**: The GitHub App ID
     - **WEBHOOK_SECRET**: The Webhook secret specified when creating the GitHub App
     - **PRIVATE_KEY**: The Base64 string associated with the GitHub Apps Private key `.pem` file

## Deploy Infrastructure 
Infrastructure is required to process webhook events. Several Azure services are used to provide the needed runtimes, configurations, and storage.

> **Note**
> In this case it is assumed that a Federated credential for GitHub Actions has been [correctly configured](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login#configure-a-federated-credential-to-use-oidc-based-authentication).

### Terraform
Use GitHub Actions ðŸš€ to execute Terraform CLI commands 

1. Create a file named `/.github/workflows/deploy_to_azure.yml` in the repository created during Step 4 of the Requirements section. Optionally update the `app-name:` value that is used in the names of Azure resources

```
name: Kermit
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
    paths:
      - 'terraform/**'
jobs:     
  Deploy:
    uses: expert-services/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/deploy_github_app.yml@main
    with:
      app-name: kermit
      cloud-provider: az
    secrets: inherit
```

2. Copy the contents of [terraform/](terraform/) into the repository created during Step 4 of the Requirements section
   1. Optionally edit the default values in the `variables.tf` file copied in Step 1
3. Upon committing the files Step 2 observe the `deploy_to_azure.yml` workflow execute
4. Update the GitHub App **Webook URL** mentioned in Step 1 of the Requirements section to the URL of the App Service that is deployed

> **Note**
> If using the default values in [terraform/variables.tf](terraform/variables.tf), resources will be deployed in the East US region

### State Management
Code is included as part of the referenced reusable workflow at  [expert-services/reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/deploy_github_app.yml](https://github.com/expert-services/reusable-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_github_app.yml) to boostrap and maintain the needed Azure infrastructure for Terraform state files. The workflow creates an Azure Storage Account `<app-name>state<GITHUB_ORG>` (omitting `-` characters, limiting the name to 24 characters), as well as a storage container named `<GITHUB_ORG>-tfstate` if they are not present. This Azure Storage Account is then referenced as part of a backend configuration for Terraform state when initializing with the `terraform` CLI. If these values create a collision or are not up to the desired naming standards, change them before executing the workflow.

```powershell 
...
...

terraform init -backend-config="resource_group_name=$($storageAccount.ResourceGroupName)" `
               -backend-config="storage_account_name=$($storageAccount.StorageAccountName)" `
               -backend-config="container_name=$env:GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER-tfstate" `
               -backend-config="key=prod.terraform.tfstate" `
               -backend-config="use_oidc=true" `
               -backend-config="subscription_id=$env:TF_VAR_subscription_id" `
               -backend-config="tenant_id=$env:TF_VAR_tenant_id" `
               -backend-config="client_id=$env:TF_VAR_client_id" && terraform plan -out out.tfplan && terraform apply -auto-approve out.tfplan

...

```
